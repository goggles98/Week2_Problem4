Motor Position Control Model

First, the model had been created.
After that, traditional controller design techniques were used to find the position for the 'zero' to be added for the PD controller.

Though running the file, 'controller_design.m', the output has considerable improved and fits the specifications, when the same model was updated in simulink and the linearized model was created along with the controller, the output wasn't as expected.

Kindly advice on what can be done.
The matlab simulations outputs have been provided in the projects.
